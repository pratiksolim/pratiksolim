# Hi, I'm Pratik 👋

### Senior Engineer @ [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
Based in Mumbai, India 🇮🇳

I engineer the high-performance distributed systems that serve **30M+ developers** globally. I specialize in **scalability and resilience**, taking full ownership of critical backend services, from architectural design and database selection to production reliability.

---

### 🚀 Production Highlights
* **Scale:** Currently managing backend distribution services handling massive concurrent loads at Postman.
* **Performance:** Experienced with **ScyllaDB** and **Redis** for ultra-low latency data layers.
* **Resiliency:** Specialist in designing idempotent APIs and managing data consistency across distributed systems.
* **Community:** I assist the developer community on the [Postman Issue Tracker](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/13895), specifically debugging app update flows for Postman users.

### 💬 Engineering Philosophy
> "Ship fast, break nothing critical."

I believe in **pragmatic engineering**—choosing the right tool for the job, prioritizing simple solutions over complex abstractions, and ensuring that "Getting Stuff Done" never compromises system stability.
